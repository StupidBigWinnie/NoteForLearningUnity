Advantage:
	-do movement;
		e.g. //CharacterController cc = ...;
		cc.move(Vector3);
	-do not affect by the forces
	-will be constrained by the collision
		detect collision -> send message -> trigger some special events;

Public Methods:(V2018.2)
	Move(Vector3);
	SimpleMove(Vector3);
	//only one method per frame is recommended
